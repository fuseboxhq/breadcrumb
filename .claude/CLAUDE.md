# Task Tracking & Planning

**Use Breadcrumb (`/bc`) for phase-based planning and execution.**

```
/bc:status         # View all phases and progress
/bc:plan           # Plan a phase with task breakdown
/bc:execute        # Execute tasks in a phase
/bc:new-phase      # Create a new phase
/bc:integrate      # Explore codebase and create context
```

**Use Beads CLI (`bd`) for task tracking.**

```
bd ready           # List tasks with no blockers
bd list            # List all tasks
bd show <id>       # View task details
bd update <id> --status in_progress  # Mark in progress
bd close <id>      # Mark complete
```

When working on this project, use Breadcrumb for all phase-based workflows and Beads CLI for task management.
